# Image Processing Algorithms

## Nearest Neighbor Interpolation

The algorithm for Nearest Neighbor Interpolations works as follows:
1. Uploaded the image, converted from RGB to gray-scale, and computed the
output size of original image.
2. Since the size of image is given, I claimed the output size of image.
3. I used for loop for computing the rows and columns. Scaling factors are
calculated. Since pixels positions cannot be image(-1, -1) or bigger than output
size of image, I did not consider them; so just iterated until it reaches the last
column or row.
4. Since image is not integer, I have used uint8() function for conversion.
5. Then new image with iterated rows and columns are equal to interpolated
size of original image.

## Bilinear Interpolation
The algorithm for Bilinear Interpolations works as follows:
1. Uploaded the image, converted from RGB to gray-scale, and computed the
1
output size of original image.
2. Since the size of image is given, I claimed the output size of image.
3. I used for loop for computing the rows and columns. Scaling factors are
calculated. Since pixels positions cannot be row = -1, col = -1 or bigger than
output size of image, I did not consider them; so just iterated until it reaches
the last column or row.
4. I have used the meshgrid() in order to simplify my coding without using for
loops because positions for pixels already defined. sub2ind() function helped
me to vectoring the pixels in order to do the interpolation without creating for
loops, since it outputs a single linear index.
5. In order to get a single linear index from the row and column for further
calculation
6. Since the pixel value is weighted average of neighbors, I have computed the
distance between nearest neighbors. To reuse the algorithm, dene the data
types separately from the algorithm.
7. Then new image with iterated rows and columns are equal to interpolated
size of original image.
As we can see from picture below, Nearest Neighbor sharpened the picture due
to it just zoomed its size, however, bilinear smoothed the picture. The output
of both images looks as follows:

## Distance transform algorithm

The exercise required to implement a distance transform algorithm on blackwhite
image, black being foreground and white being background as follows, so
that the process looks as follows:
1. Uploaded the image, and converted to black-white image
2. Defined the values of new image, and found the max value in rows and
columns. This is used in order to conversion the highest value to 255 as the
task requires.
3. Used the for loop for iterating the pixels x = 1, 2, etc. There are 8 different
if-statements for borders of image in order to avoid out ranges. If row = 1 and
col = 1 the intensity of image is 0 and 4-adjacency pixels are 1 in the original
image, then the new image would take the value 1. 8 neighbor points get the
following values 2, 3, 4, etc. as the iteration continues.
4. Since the highest value of pixel is available, we have used the following to
normalize into 255. M = max(A,[],'all') function helped to find the highest
intensity among the pixels, and I converted into 0:255 scale. With a help of

floor() function, I rounded the 
oating value into integer value.
5. Plotted the original and output images, and their difference shown below:

## Masks (3x3) (5x5) (7x7)

The objective of the first task is to implement a filter that changes the intensity values of the
original image. The mask we apply is the size of NxN, where N is an odd number and flexible for
changes. The beginning of the mask starts with this mask:
```
$ mask = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 10]
```
In order to change the values of the borders, an input image was produced with black borders.
The algorithm is as follows: first of all, the mask size was assigned as m and n . Since the mask
that we apply must not be fixed, mask size is as an example changed to 5x5 and 7x7:
```
$ [m, n] = size (mask);
$ a = (m-1)/2;
$ b = (n-1)/2;
```
In order to create an input image that contains an original image with black borders, the padding
has been used. The input image dimensions will be 2a and 2b bigger than original. The matrix img
is the input image with black borders, row and col are rows and columns of the original image:
```
$ img = zeros (row+2*a ,col+2*b);
$ for r = 1:row
$  for c = 1:col
$   img(r+a, c+b) = image(r, c);
$  end
$ end
```
Applying the mask to the input image provided the different intensity values for an output image.
However, the output image was too bright, so that normalization of output image helped me to
overcome this problem.

## Sobel Operator

The objective of this task is to find the edges by applying the Sobel Operator to the original image.
In order to create the Sobel image, two masks were provided.
```
Gx = [-1,0,1;-2,0,2;-1,0,1];
Gy = [-1,-2,-1;0,0,0;1,2,1];
```
The algorithm for the Sobel image is the same as the first task. First of all, the original image
house.jpg is provided, the padding has been applied to the original image in order to ensure that
the dimensions of an output image is the same as an original image. Secondly, two different
masks Gx and Gy have been multiplied to input images, so that two different outputs for fx and fy .
In order to get the final output Sobel image f , the output image with Gx and the output image with
Gy by the following equation:
```
f = âˆšfx2 + fy2
```

Adding some threshold, significantly changes the image:
